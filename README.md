# Diet Management System (DMS)

The Diet Management System is a comprehensive Flask-based REST API that helps users track their dietary habits, manage food information, and monitor nutritional intake. The system provides features for logging food consumption, tracking allergies, generating meal suggestions, and analyzing nutritional data.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, and manage user profiles
- **Food Database**: Maintain a catalog of foods with descriptions and images
- **Ingredient Tracking**: Track ingredients used in each food
- **Nutrition Information**: Store and retrieve nutritional data for foods
- **Food Logging**: Allow users to log what they eat and view consumption history
- **Allergy Management**: Track food allergies and provide warnings when attempting to consume allergenic foods
- **Menu Suggestions**: Generate random meal suggestions based on user's allergy information

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (development/production) or SQLite (testing)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI via Flasgger
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Database Migrations**: Alembic with Flask-Migrate

## Installation

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abogo-nono/dms
   cd dms
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (or create a `.env` file):
   ```
   FLASK_APP=run.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///dms_db.db  # For local development
   ```

5. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Docker Development Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory

2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` or use the existing one

3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. The API will be available at http://localhost:8000
   
5. Access the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:8000/api/docs/

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, use the production Docker Compose file:

```bash
FLASK_ENV=production docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Make sure to set secure database credentials in your production environment.
